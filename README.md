This is the news webpage that I created to complete the WebLab Team Member task. 
I named the page after my cat Köpük. He's been very precious to me since he first came to our home almost 5 years ago, and I like to include him somewhere in my projects. 
If you click on the "Site ismi için ilham kaynağım:Köpük" text at the bottom of the page, it will take you to a Pinterest page with photos of Köpük.
